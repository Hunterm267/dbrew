== Short-term TODOs

Replace asserts with correct error handling for
* decoder [done]
* emulator
* generator

API:
* rewriting function for arbitrary parameters

Tests:
* emulator
* generator
* [more details](../tests/TODO.md)

Emulation
* config to catch memory writes via hash table
* config to error out on non-static branching
* pure capturing (no need to emulate anything unknown)
* track meta info for vector registers
* callbacks during emulation
* inlining of callbacks?

Optimizations:
* liveness analysis, remove unneeded instructions
* register renaming, upgrade spilled stack-values into registers
* vectorization?

Multiple ISAs:
* subdirs per ISA
* simple one like RiscV ?
