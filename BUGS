Bugs:

* Revert to (operand) types just mentioning bit width
  (no VT_64 vs. VT_V64 etc)

MAYBE FIX:

* RIP-relative addressing of data may need constant pool

Missing in Generator:
* 400cda: 66 48 0f 7e c0    movq   %xmm0,%rax
  (stencil)

* movq   %xmm0,%rax: should set capture state of %rax to dynamic
